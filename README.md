# unit-4-game
week 4 jquery hw assignment
This project utilized the different components of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and most importantly Jquery. It is a crystal collector game where players will click on one of the four crystals (each with a different value between 1-12) in order to try and match the randomized target number (this value is between 19-120). If the score matches, the wins counter will add 1 and a text of "You Won will append to the div section underneath the wins and losses. Vice versa if your score exceeds the target number.
